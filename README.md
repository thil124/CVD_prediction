# CVD detection

This project aims to use various ML models to see how cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection can be improved.

In this project we are specifically looking at using non clinical data, meaning data that can be obtained without using specialised tests.

## Running the project

This project uses jupyter notebooks. To run the code, press "run all"

## Data

Our data, contained in the **CVD_cleaned.csv** file is sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshwardhanfartale/cardiovascular-disease-risk-prediction-dataset?resource=download).

It is a dataset of over 300 thousand UK participants, that indicates their health along with some lifestyle data at time t, and whether they got diagnosed with a CVD in the next 10 years.

## Models

The models we are currently looked at are:
- LightGBM
- KNN
- SVM
- XGBoost
- RF
- LR
